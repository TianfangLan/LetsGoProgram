 * the relative path is: 'assignemnt/answers', then
 * the relative path can be reconstructed as:
 * '/usr/daniel/stuff/assignment/answers', and therefore
 * we can separate it to two parts.<br>
 * Parent: '/usr/daniel/stuff'<br>
 * Child: 'assignment/answers'<br>
 * Put them together: /usr/daniel/stuff/assignment/answers'<br>
 * RelativePath inherits {@link Path} since it is a kind of path.
