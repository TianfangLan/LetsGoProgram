What did I work on in the last three days?
    - finish mkdir and cd command class
	- create base code of ls and history command class
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - fix the ls and history command class

Am I blocked on anything?
    - try to change String<path> to become a Path
    - Need to rebuild the input class before continue the history class
